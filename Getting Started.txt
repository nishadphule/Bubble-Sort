What is Bubble Sort :
    
    Bubble Sort is a sorting techniques used to sort arrays in ascending or descending orders.
    This algorithm works by comparing adjacent elements of an array or a string and swapping them if they are out of place.
    Since it compares only two elements at a time, it is not an optimal solution for Sorting large datasets.
    But it is preferable for sorting datasets with less number of elements.

Head on to the code section to see how Bubble Sort actually works!
